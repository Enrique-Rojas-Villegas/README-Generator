# README Generator

## Description

- What was your motivation? <br>
  This was an idea I had to focus more on coding, and test the abilities I have gained over the last 3 months.

- Why did you build this project? <br>
  It started as an idea for a simple generator, but soon turned into a real challenge, and to add more and more functionality to the project.

- What problem does it solve? <br>
  Saves time when writing a Quality ReadMe, and for the coder to focus more time onto coding, while presenting a quality description of their project.

- What did you learn? <br>
  Learned about fs, inquire and how we could prompt for the user input, and to use that input dynamically to create any type of document.
  <br>
- Briefly describe your Project: <br>
  The README Generator, prompts the user a series of questions, and when answered takes those inputs and dynamically saves them and adds them to a README Template, the user can add images, email domains by copying the snnipets provided in the console to be faster at writing.
